basic relayer
=============

  - a basic relay implementation based on relayer.
  - uses postgres, which I think must be over version 12 since it uses generated columns.
  - it has some antispam limits, tries to delete old stuff so things don't get out of control, and some other small optimizations, but it's something we can call "hardened".

running
-------

grab a binary from the releases page and run it with the environment variable POSTGRESQL_DATABASE set to some postgres url:

    POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=postgres://name:pass@localhost:5432/dbname ./relayer

it also accepts a HOST and a PORT environment variables.

compiling
---------

if you know Go you already know this:

    go get github.com/fiatjaf/relayer/basic

or something like that.
